# CPolygonHandler
A class hierarchy for creating and manipulating polygon shapes, storing the coordinates of the vertices.

// Minimum specification :
Abstract base class for 2D polygons
Derived classes for : at least an isosceles triangle; rectangle; pentagon; hexagon
Pure virtual functions to translate each polygon in the x, y plane, to rescale its shape in x, y, and rotate it by a specified angle about its centre.
Polygon stores co - ordinates of each vertex in a suitable form
Rotation function implements matrix multiplication using a 2x2 rotation matrix

// Minimum functionality :
User inputs details for polygons, creating library using STL container or array of base class pointers
Program demonstrates manipulation of polygons(translation, rescaling, rotation)
Program outputs details of each polygon

//Extra functionality
Test for overlap between polygons;
Area of the overlap;
Manipulation of the overlap
Extensive outputs
